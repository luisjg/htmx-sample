<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>This Single Page Web Application (SPWA) was part of a research grant
which analyzed earnings data across 5 California State University
campuses that span the Metropolitan Los Angeles area. The goal was to
convey via charts that staying in school and completing a degree yields
higher wages in the long run. To that end
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB was commissioned to make
the web application portion of the research grant into reality.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The challenges that this project presented were two-fold. On the one
hand, it was our first time working on a project that focused on
representing data in chart form. On the other hand, it was also our
first time working with big data which required the use of Python,
Pandas, and some R to analyze and filter down various CSV files to fit
the application's MySQL needs.</p>
<p>With this in mind the development was broken down into three teams:
The front end team was in-charge of finding open source chart libraries
that produced charts which were easy to navigate as well as making them
accessible from an a11y stand point. The back end team was split in two;
one part of the back end team was tasked with building out the various
API endpoints and cache mechanism that the front end would hit, and the
rest of the back end team focused on filtering out the data - using
Python, Pandas, and R - as well as managing the data import into
MySQL.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>As the lead software engineer on this project, one of the keys in
making sure that each phase of the project was completed on time was to
have a clear software design that everyone understood. To accomplish
this, another key was to have constant communication amongst the
development team as well as with the client to make sure that everyone
was on the same page. This of course was difficult in the beginning but
establishing consistent schedules and updates was another key in
achieving the project's completion.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>
<hr />
<p>We decided to stick with a our tried and true web stack of Bootstrap
CSS, VueJs, and Laravel all hosted on two AWS spot instances. Utilizing
VueJs was the right call because it had all the necessary first party
and third party libraries in place to accomplish the task of building a
SPWA. For the chart functionality we used Vue-ECharts which is a third
party Vue wrapper for Apache ECharts. The front-end routing was handled
by Vue Router, and the application's state management was done with
VueX. Together with Vue and Bootstrap we were able to build an easy to
navigate and quick to respond SPWA.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<hr />
<p>The following is a list of the various roles that I assumed during
the development of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead Software Engineer</li>
<li>Lead Developer</li>
<li>Code Reviewer</li>
<li>QA Lead</li>
</ul>
