<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>A personal website designed and written by myself, this website as a
playground to hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills as well as to
keep up with the latest front-end technologies. There have been various
versions of this site and you can see the evolution over on this site's

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The challenge that this project presented me with revolved around my
lack of front-end knowledge. Early during my career as a web developer
my day to day revolved around doing back-end work, so in order to
challenge myself and understand the full picture, I decided to go the
extra mile and get to work with and familiarize myself with the various
front-end tools and libraries out there.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>The lessons that I learned going through and challenging myself with
doing front-end work allowed me to be a more well rounded developer. In
addition to that, the skills gained allowed me to contribute with the
various development teams that I worked with. I was able to relate with
the front-end team which allowed me to design the back-end to do as much
of the heavily lifting as possible to help create performant web
applications. Overall, it was a great decision for me since I was able
to learn JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Sass HTML, and VueJs as well as get
familiar with the various build tools and processes such as Npm, Yarn,
and WebPack.</p>

<p>This latest version of the website is generated by the static site
generator <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a>. To aid in code
organization, I used the <a

template made by <a href="https://mattwaler.com/">Matt Waler</a>. It
comes pre-configured with Tailwind CSS, EleventyJs, and AlpineJs. It
follows ARIA accessibility guidelines as well as utilizing a colorblind
friendly color palette. Finally, hosting is being handled via GitHub
pages.</p>
