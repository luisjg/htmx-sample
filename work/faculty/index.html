<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>The Faculty web application was built by
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB and commissioned by the
CSUN Office of Faculty Affairs and the CSUN Office of the Provost in
order to highlight CSUN’s diverse faculty. The web application also
serves as a hub for students to easily find a faculty member’s office
hours, class syllabi, contact information, and their research
interests.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The challenges that this project presented revolved around getting
access to the faculty data that is already being collected by the
university. This data includes office hours, contact information, which
department they teach under, as well as their class schedule. Once
agreements and the appropriate access to the Oracle Database was given,
the next hurdle was to organize the data in such a way that made the
software design straightforward.</p>
<p>In order to get to that point, the data had to be altered to fit the
desired target MySQL database schema and have it done in a consistent
way for each upcoming semester. To achieve this, bash scripts were
utilized and ran on a schedule to do the necessary synchronizations.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>On paper this might seem like a straightforward project but due to
the way the data was being stored and not exposed through APIs, it
quickly became a very ambitions project with multiple phases that lent
itself for a case study in project management. This fact was not lost
with leadership and we were instructed to tackle items and features as
the data was made available to us. Seeing how successful this approach
was allowed the team and department to buy-in to the Agile Scrum
methodology as this was the first project such approach was
implemented.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>
<hr />
<p>The web application portion was written in Laravel, Bootstrap CSS,
HTML, JavaScript, and a bit of VueJs. The Oracle to MySQL database
synchronization system was written primarily in Bash. Additionally it
utilizes different internally built APIs for class schedule, office
hours, class location, as well as OpenStreetMaps for the map itself. All
of the API requests are saved to a cache system that is refreshed every
day.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<hr />
<p>The following is a list of the various roles that I assumed during
the development of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Code Reviewer</li>
<li>QA Lead</li>
</ul>
