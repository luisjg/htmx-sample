<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>These public facing APIs were created by
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB in order to provide
developers an easy way to get up and running with their CSUN specific
applications. Great care was taken with the data so as to not expose any
private or student information and only expose publicly available
information: classroom location, faculty information, class information,
and awards given to faculty members.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The challenge that this project solved was to make
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB development more
streamlined when it came to CSUN specific projects. Up to that point,
every project was a monolith that had access to various databases and
views in order to get the job done. This set-up was fine at the
beginning but we were quickly adapting to the times and seeing that
front-end libraries such as VueJs, AngularJs, and ReactJs allowed us to
serve data piecemeal in order to create a better web experience it made
sense to create a lot of APIs to speed up development process.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>Having gone through and developing the internal APIs had the positive
effect of taking inventory of all of our data. This allowed us to become
comfortable with where the data lived, as well as apply any improvements
on the database layer for faster data look-ups. Another lesson that I
took away was that it is easier for a front-end developer to interact
with an API that is already built vs having to wait for the back-end
team to make custom API end-points. This approach afforded us faster
development cycles.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>
<hr />
<p>All of the APIs were written with Laravel Lumen, are being hosted on
AWS, and are set-up to avoid any CORS issues.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<hr />
<p>The following is a list of the various roles that I assumed during
the development of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrum Master</li>
<li>Lad Developer</li>
<li>Lead Software Engineer</li>
<li>QA Lead</li>
</ul>
