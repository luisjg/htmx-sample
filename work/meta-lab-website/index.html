<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>The CSUN META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB website was
built by META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB and highlights
what the department is all about. At a glance visitors can see
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB's purpose, what the student
vetting process is, the different projects that
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB was commissioned to build,
and information on how to join.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The main challenge for the current version of the website was to
transition out of the previous tech stack and into our current tech
stack. The previous version of the website was a WordPress install being
hosted on our own infrastructure. The decision was made to modernize
this as well as to apply our skill set in our web stack in order to
highlight our skills. Migrating the existing database data from
WordPress was not required and only the images were migrated over.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>Since this was an internal application, it served as a playground for
us to show-off our skills. We experimented with various AWS features
such as CDN creation, S3 storage, image compression techniques, and
scheduling the server hosting the website to be destroyed and
re-deployed which served as great preparation for our CI/CD
pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>
<hr />
<p>The application is written in Laravel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
application is being hosted on AWS and a CDN was created to serve the
Stylesheets, JavaScript, and images to speed up application response.
Employing these techniques was an exercise to illustrate our skill
growth.</p>
