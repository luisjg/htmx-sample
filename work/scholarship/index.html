<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>Scholarship is part of the Faculty web application suite which was
built by META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB and commissioned
by the CSUN Office of Faculty Affairs and the CSUN Office of the
Provost. This web application serves as the research hub that showcases
all of the grant funded projects as well as non-grant funded projects
taking place at CSUN. Showcasing this information allows the campus
community to know what research is going on as well as provide an
opportunity to join in on the research project.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<hr />
<p>The challenges that this project presented revolved around getting
access to the research data that is already being recorded into <a
href="https://cayuse.com/">Cayuse</a>. Some of the data includes grant
award amount, length of the research, title, abstract, as well as any
additional team members. Once agreements were made and the appropriate
access to Cayuse was given, the next hurdle was to organize the data in
such a way that made the software design straightforward.</p>
<p>The other challenge outside of the Cayuse data was how to categorize
each project into a category hierarchy that made sense, and was easy to
search for. This was the main hurdle of the project due to the lack of
experience of building such a system.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<hr />
<p>A lot of the heavy lifting for this project was taken care of during
the development of the Faculty project, so the lessons learned there
were applied to Scholarship. That previous experience allowed us to
confidently set-up the Cayuse data syncs. This allowed us to focus on
creating the research categorization tool which went through many
renditions until everyone was happy with the results. Having the luxury
of devoting a lot of time to the categorization tool made me appreciate
having a good project timeline.</p>
<h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2>
<hr />
<p>The web application was written in Laravel, Bootstrap CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, and jQuery. The Cayuse to MySQL database synchronization
system was written in Bash and runs each morning on a set schedule.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<hr />
<p>The following is a list of the various roles that I assumed during
the development of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer</li>
<li>Code Reviewer</li>
<li>QA Lead</li>
</ul>
