<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>I had the opportunity to work at <strong>CSUN
META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB</strong>, a university ran
tech start-up located in Northridge, California for my senior year
internship. This was an amazing experience where I was able to work
alongside other interns as well as experienced staff Developers and
staff Designers to build multiple powerful client facing products.</p>
<p>My tenure at META<span style="color:#d00d2d;">+</span>LAB not only
tested my skills but also honed them, allowing me to emerge as a more
evolved individual and developer.</p>
